# Ball-Sort
Just a recursive ball sorting algorithm based in Dr. Racket. Still a bit of a work-in-progress in finding a better way to run it.

To run, open up the file tubes.rkt in Dr. Racket. There's a few test games that are commented in orange.
Simply uncomment and run the program to watch the balls get sorted!
